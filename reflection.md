Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I did not consult any classmates yet, aside from taking note of problems in class. I also used an origami crane to say out loud what I was doing when I had to redo a big portion of my program.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I did not attend TA/office hours yet.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    It's challenging, but I'm still learning.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    There are a lot of ways to do one task in programming, but finding the most efficient way is hard.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
     My first solution for the transcript was to concatenate each phrase to a string. I tried using python syntax, """ """ string but that didn't work, so I made a String object and kept concactenating to it and adding a new line manually. 
     But after finishing that I saw that I was supposed to use an array. Having to redo a lot of my code did help me pick up some of the bugs like not all of the words getting mirrored if there were multiple pronouns. my problem was that I was setting each botResponse to response instead of updating it each time, which made some mirrors get overridden.
