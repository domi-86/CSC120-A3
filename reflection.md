Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I did not consult any classmates yet, aside from taking note of problems in class. I also used an origami crane.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I did not attend TA/office hours yet.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    It isn't too hard yet, but I am still learning.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Some things are better done object-oriented, some things aren't. These two languages are made to be effiecient and there are ways to save space.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I tried using python syntax, """ """ string but that didn't work, so I made a String object and kept concactenating to it and adding a new line manually. My first solution for the transcript was to make an array and put each line in a spot, then print the array, but then I thought that was probably too complicated, but then I saw that that was what I am supposed to do.
    Initially, replacing the period with a question mark, I was trying to do "response.replace(".","?") at the end, which is wrong because I made a variable for the mirrored version. I doubt the way I did it is most efficient, but making use of substrings and String methods is very helpful. 


Current Problem: won't mirror all words, only 1
example "I'm thinking about my class" gets mirrored to "I'm thinking about your class?"
